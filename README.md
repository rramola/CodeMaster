Unit Project (JavaScript/React) Requirements

*Presentations on March 26*

Your job is to create a React app that utilizes a public API. You can find public APIs from a quick Google search. For reference, here is a repo that contains a ton of free APIs free of use: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis

Note: Make sure to integrate with APIs that don't require any authentication. You will learn more about authentication such as OAuth2 and Api Keys later in the year.

We want you to integrate with APIs that have multiple HTTP methods. You may have seen/heard of us mention CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Create being a POST, Read being a GET, Update being a PUT, and Delete being a DELETE. If you want to learn more about different HTTP methods or learn more about them, here is a helpful link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods.

The required methods we would like to see you use is an example of the following:
Create a CRUD app that interacts with data with local json
Have functionality on your app to pull all data, pull data by a specific entry, create json data, update json data, and remove json data
If you want, you can still use a free api to pull and interact with actual data
For example, you call a dealership api to pull all the cars on their lot. You then format that json in whatever structure you feel would be most efficient. Then, you create UI components to allow the user to add a new car which would append to that json data you stored locally from the api. Say there’s a component to view a specific car, you would query your local json data to grab the data for the specific car they clicked on and so forth.
There should be a “components” folder in the “src” directory that contains a folder for each component then your actual jsx component in that (reference Logan’s pizza practice)
*You must use React and be sure to style your web app to make it presentable*

To submit, send Logan, Briana, and Trey the link to your github repository. Be sure to deploy your app to GitHub pages.

Helpful Tools:
Postman
 Postman is an application that allows the testing of web APIs. With Postman, you can call APIs to call them and interact with them before actually implementing the logic into your code.
You can download the postman app or use the browser version (you will need to create an account)
